There are a few ideas to get around the problem:
1) Create a local version of the html files. This way, I have the same thing communicating with itself. The state farms guys thought I would still need a reqest, but I dont think they knew what I wanted
2) Make a separate doc file, so that there is not communication, just a single doc file. could work.
